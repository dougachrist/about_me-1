  <li>Bio</li>
    <p>Hi!I am from Taiwan, and I came to the United States when I was 14 years old. I attened highschool in Nashville,Tennessee. Later I attended college in San Diego, California. I love to travel. Recently I just took a road trip with my family and friends from LA to Death Valley, Yosemite, Napa,San Fransisco, and Big Sur. I love to learn new things. I am learning Spanish which I enjoy alot. Luckily,I get to practice with native speakers and learn their culture becasue I live in SoCal. Now, I am learning another "language" which allows me to create fantasic wbe pages and furthermore to connect to more people without boundary. So excited!

  <li>An Overview of my Job Experience</li>
  <p>Jobless. I did multiple internships in the past. I worked in an autism lab at a children hospital by running tests, collecting data and coding videos. Also I did an internship at a learning and motivation lab. I worked with a pigeon, yes, a pigeon, and tried to train the pigeon to perform some behaviors by giving it different reinforcement schedules.

  <li>My Goals</li>
  <p>
  After switching back and forth different majors and minors at school, recently I finally found out what I am interested in the most. I took a human-centered disign studio class and decided to specilize in UI/UX becasue it is just so much fun! My goal for this class is to acquire HTML,CSS and Javascript skills in order to redesign or create something meaningful.
