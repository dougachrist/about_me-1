  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>Bio</li>
    <p>I am from Taiwan, and I came to the United States when I was 14 years old. Bravely travelled alone and studied in a highschool near Nashville, Tennessee. In my senior year, I got accepted to both Univeristy of Washinton, Seattle and University of California, San Diego. It was one of the hardest decision in my life. Fortunately, I love the sunshine and the beach in SolCal. Unfortunately, I did not get to explore the coffee shops in Seattle. Fortunately, I get to spend this summer here....
